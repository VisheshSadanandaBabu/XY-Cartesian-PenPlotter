# XY-Cartesian-PenPlotter
This repository contain lines of codes executable in an Arduino UNO Microcontroller to prompt the working of an XY-Pen Plotter device of my own fabrication. The main motive was to design and fabricate a functional XY-Cartesian Pen Plotter supported by an Arduino UNO Microcontroller and to successfully operate it to draw the diagram of my choice (Nikolaus House).
